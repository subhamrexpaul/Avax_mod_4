# DEGENTOKEN Odyssey | Unleashing the Power of AVAX

Welcome to the mesmerizing world of DEGENTOKEN as we embark on an epic odyssey through Module 4 of the legendary `ETH_AVAX` course, graciously bestowed upon us by the revered `Metacrafters`.

## Chronicles of Creation

Behold, within this grand tapestry, I have woven the intricate threads of a token known as `DEGEN`, a symbol of defiance and honor, branded as `REX`. This token, a relic of my creation, carries the promise of rewarding valiant players within the confines of a game. These earned treasures hold the key to unlocking the coveted treasures within the `foodShop`, a realm where exclusive game items await their rightful owners. To add to its mystique, this token is tailored for deployment upon the majestic AVALANCHE Blockchain.

## Commencing the Odyssey

### The Initiation Ritual

- To join this odyssey, fork the repository and summon its essence into your personal workspace.
- Conjure the necessary energies by invoking the `npm i` incantation, beckoning the required dependencies.
- Your treasury shall require a bounty of AVAX tokens to fuel the journey ahead. You'll find guidance within the sacred scrolls, the revered `GUIDE.md`.

### The Enchanted Performance

As you prepare to bear witness to this arcane performance, ensure you are attuned to your unique credentials and are adorned with the mighty Meta Mask for interaction. Craft your own key by inscribing the `PRIVATE_KEY` and `API_KEY` upon the ethereal canvas of your `.env` parchment. Now, the culmination of your efforts awaits—the summoning of the contract onto the revered `fuji` network. You shall channel your power through the invocation:
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network fuji
```

Embrace the arcane, for this odyssey is not merely a journey—it is a testament to the fusion of art and code, tokens and magic, and the boundless horizons of the blockchain realm.
