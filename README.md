# DEGENTOKEN | USING AVAX
This is the project submission of module 4 of the `ETH_AVAX` course provided by `Metacrafters`.

## Description

In this project, I created a token named `DEGEN` and the symbol `DGN`. This token is built to reward players in a game which can be redeemed in `GameShop` to buy exclusive game items. Also, it is created to be deployed on AVALANCHE Blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Installing

- Fork this repository and clone it into your workspace.
- You have to install all necessary dependencies by using the `npm i` command.
- You need to have some AVAX tokens in your account to deploy the contract. (You can refer to `GUIDE.md`)

### Executing program

Before executing make sure you have your own credentials and meta mask account to interact with the contract. Create your own `.env` file and add `PRIVATE_KEY` and `API_KEY` into it. After all this setup, you need to deploy the contract on a `fuji` network. You can use this command-
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network fuji
```

## Help

Make sure you've switched to the `AVALANCHE FUJI-C Chain network on Metamask. (refer to GUIDE.md)

## Authors

This contract is created by `UDIT GUPTA` with the help of `METACRAFTERS Team`.
